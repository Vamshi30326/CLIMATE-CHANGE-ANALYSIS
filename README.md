# CLIMATE-CHANGE-ANALYSIS
Global environmental change is more extreme than at any other time in recorded history. Its local realities increasingly uproot large numbers of people. Global climate change is increasingly accepted by both the scientific community and the general public as a reality that must be addressed in both policy and practice. The recent reports from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change affirm that human-induced factors are responsible for generating significant increases in temperatures around the world. The environmental degradation of local ecosystems compounded by the local effects of global climate change can result in the loss of sufficient resources and other ecosystem services.

This project aims to describe how sustainability climate issues can be managed. More precisely, how can Big Data, through data science answer sustainability climate issues and be applicable in decision sciences in an integrated manner.
